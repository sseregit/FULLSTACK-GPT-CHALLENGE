The issue has been given theCommon Vulnerabilities and ExposuresnumberCVE-2024-3094and has been assigned aCVSSscore of 10.0, the highest possible score.[5]While xz is commonly present in mostLinux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed toproductionsystems, but was present in development versions of major distributions.[6]The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.[7]Background[edit]Microsoft employee andPostgreSQLdeveloper Andres Freund reported the backdoor after investigating aperformance regressioninDebian Sid.[8]Freund noticed that SSH connections were generating an unexpectedly high amount of CPU usage as well as causing errors inValgrind,[9]a memory debugging tool.[10]Freund reported his finding toOpenwall Project\\'s open source security mailing list,[9]which brought it to the attention of various software vendors.[10]The attacker made efforts to obfuscate the code,[11]as the backdoor consists of multiple stages that act together.[12]Once the compromised version is incorporated into the operating system, it alters the behavior ofOpenSSH\\'sSSHserver daemon by abusing thesystemdlibrary, allowing the attacker to gain administrator access.[12][10]According to the analysis byRed Hat, the backdoor can \"enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely\".[13]A subsequent investigation found that the campaign to insert the backdoor into theXZ Utilsproject was a culmination of approximately three years of effort, between November 2021 and February 2024,[14]by a user going by the nameJia Tanand the nickname JiaT75 to gain access to a position of trust within the project. After a period of pressure on the founder and head maintainer to hand over the control of the project via apparentsock puppetry,Jia Tangained the position of co-maintainer ofXZ Utilsand was able to sign off on version 5.6.0, which introduced the backdoor, and version 5.6.1, which patched some anomalous behavior that could have been apparent during software testing of the operating system.[10]Some of the suspected sock puppetry pseudonyms include accounts with usernames likeJigar Kumar,krygorin4545, andmisoeater91. It is suspected that the namesJia Tan, as well as the supposed code authorHans Jansen(for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1), are pseudonyms chosen by the participants of the campaign. Neither have any sort of visible public presence in software development beyond the short few years of the campaign.[15][16][17]The backdoor was notable for its level of sophistication and for the fact that the perpetrator practiced a high level ofoperational securityfor a long period of time while working to attain a position of trust. American security researcherDave Aitelhas suggested that it fits the pattern attributable toAPT29, anadvanced persistent threat actorbelieved to be working on behalf of theRussianForeign Intelligence Service(SVR).[14]Journalist Thomas Claburn suggested that it could be any state actor or a non-state actor with considerable resources.[18]Mechanism[edit]The malicious code is known to be in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. Theexploitremains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshdauthenticationand gain unauthorized access to the entire systemremotely.[13]The malicious mechanism consists of two compressed test files that contain the malicious binary code. These files are available in thegit repository, but remain dormant unless extracted and injected into the program.[4]The code uses theglibcIFUNCmechanism to replace an existing function inOpenSSHcalledRSA_public_decryptwith a malicious version. OpenSSH normally does not load liblzma, but a common third-partypatchused by several Linux distributions causes it to loadlibsystemd, which in turn loads lzma.[4]A modified version ofbuild-to-host.m4was included in the release tar file uploaded onGitHub, which extracts a script that performs the actual injection intoliblzma. This modifiedm4file was not present in the git repository; it was only available fromtar filesreleased by the maintainer separate from git.[4]The script appears to perform the injection only when the system is being built on anx86-64Linux system that uses glibc andGCCand is being built viadpkgorrpm.[4]Response[edit]Remediation[edit]The US federalCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agencyissued a security advisory recommending that the affected devices should roll back to a previous uncompromised version.[19]Linux software vendors, including Red Hat,SUSE, andDebian, reverted the affected packages to older versions.[13][20][21]GitHubdisabled the mirrors for the xz repository before subsequently restoring them.[22]Canonicalpostponed thebeta releaseofUbuntu 24.04 LTSand itsflavoursby a week and opted for a complete binary rebuild of all the distribution\\'s packages.[23]Although the stable version of Ubuntu was not affected,upstreamversions were. This precautionary measure was taken because Canonical could not guarantee by the original release deadline that the discovered backdoor did not affect additional packages during compilation.[24]In August 2025, Binarly researchers found several Debian Docker images on Docker Hub that still have the XZ Utils backdoor.[25][26][27]The Debian development team declined to remove the affected images, stating that they were development builds that should not be used on real systems in place of newer, clean container versions.Broader response[edit]Computer scientistAlex Stamosopined that \"this could have been the most widespread and effective backdoor ever planted in any software product\", noting that had the backdoor remained undetected, it would have \"given its creators amaster keyto any of the hundreds of millions of computers around the world that run SSH\".[28]In addition, the incident also started a discussion regarding the viability of having critical pieces ofcyberinfrastructuredepend on unpaid volunteers.[29]Notes[edit]^The vulnerability was effectively patched within hours of disclosure by reverting to a previous version known to be safe.^Whether Jia Tan is a group of people, a real name of a single person or a pseudonym of a single person is not known publicly.References[edit]^Freire, Rodrigo (30 April 2024).\"Understanding Red Hat\\'s response to the XZ security incident\".redhat.com.
